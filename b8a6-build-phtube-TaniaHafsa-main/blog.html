        Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's important to use null when you want to indicate the explicit
        absence of a value or to reset a variable or property to a non-value
        state. On the other hand, undefined typically represents the
        unintentional absence of a value, such as when a variable hasn't been
        initialized or a property doesn't exist. In general, it's a good
        practice to use null when you want to assign a specific value to
        indicate absence or reset, and let JavaScript assign undefined when it
        represents the natural state of something not having a value yet.

      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What do you mean by REST API</h1>
      <p>
        REST APIs are used to allow different software systems to communicate
        with each other over the internet using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol) methods. <br />
        RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on
        resources. The most commonly used HTTP methods are: <br />
        GET: Retrieve data from the server. POST: Create a new resource on the
        server. <br />
        PUT: Update an existing resource on the server (or create it if it
        doesn't exist). <br />
        DELETE: Remove a resource from the server. <br />
        PATCH: Partially update a resource.
